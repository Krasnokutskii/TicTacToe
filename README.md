# TicTacToe
The app created to investigate the ability of Swift UI

#### Outcome 
Adventages:
- Swift UI is easy to understand and easy to start.
- Code is more readable, especially UI-related code.
- Binding and Combine is easy and powerful.
- Less code
- The same code for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and WatchOS with a few small adjustments. 

Disadventages 
- Some of the older devices are not supported 
- It can be hard to deliver an exact UI (required more tests)
